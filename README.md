# Recommendation-System
Hadoop based movie recommendation system
◦ Designed an item collaborative filtering algorithm for a Netflix movie recommender system and similar movies were recommended to users based on their favourite movies in watching history with Java, Hadoop and Docker.
◦ Accomplished the User rating matrix and the co-occurrence matrix between movies and then rearranged them to compute the recommend list based on the dataset with size up to around 1GB provided in the Netflix competition.
◦ Developed a workflow to efficiently realize the inner product between matrices in the MapReduce.
